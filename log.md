# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 7, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Filterbanks demonstration jupyter matlab notebook.

**Thoughts:** Need better way to demonstrate the Filterbanks, requiring PER. Too much time spent programming.

**Link(s) to work:** G:\Dropbox\programming\Jupyter\single_SOM__vary_number_of_filterbanks__PER

### Day 1: January 8, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: MFCCs. Building DockerFile.

**Thoughts:** Do we need to go above 23 MFCCs? So brittle...

### Day 1: January 8, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Moving to MATLAB Live Scripts instead of Jypyter

**Thoughts:** Jupyter allows us to interactively work on the web, but MATLAB Live Scripts allows us to publish in HTML/Latex format, so unless we need to have an interactive service on the web, MATLAB's version is fine and it's more mature.
